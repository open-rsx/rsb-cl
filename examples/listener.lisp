;; mark-start::body
;; For managing the lifetime of listeners (e.g. for short-lived
;; listeners), the `with-participant' macro can used. It will take care
;; of disposing of the `listener' instance after it has been used,
;; also in case of non-local exist.
;;
;; To register a handler with limited lifetime, the `with-handler'
;; macro can be used.
;; mark-start::with-participant

      ((event)
       (format t "Received event: ~A~%" event))

;; mark-end::with-participant

;; This will create a `listener' instance that receives events which
;; are sent to the channel designated by the scope
;; "/example/listener". The listener will use all transports which are
;; enabled in the configuration with their respective configured
;; options.

;; Just after creation, the listener will not act upon received
;; events. In order to process received events, handlers have to be
;; added to the listener. A handler is a function of one argument, the
;; event.

;; The listener will participate in the channel until it is garbage
;; collected or explicitly detached using the `rsb:detach' function.

;; In order to be notified about and react on event receiving errors,
;; additional error handlers can to be registered.
