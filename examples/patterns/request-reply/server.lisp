;; For managing the lifetime of `local-server' instances (e.g. for
;; short-lived clients), the `with-local-server' macro can used. It
;; will take care of disposing of the `local-server' instance after it
;; has been used, also in case of non-local exist.
;;
;; Methods can be managed similarly. After the `with-methods' form,
;; the methods are removed.

;; Create a `local-server' instance that offers its methods under the
;; scope "/example/clientserver".
;; The local server will use all transports which are enabled in the
;; global RSB configuration with their respective configured options.
;;
;; The new server instance initially does not have any methods. There
;; are several ways to add methods.
